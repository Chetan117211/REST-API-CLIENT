**I have successfully completed the task of developing a Java application that consumes a public REST API to fetch and display weather data in a structured format.
To perform this task, I took guidance from various sources including YouTube tutorials, ChatGPT assistance, and valuable suggestions from my friends, which helped me understand API handling using Java (HTTP requests and JSON parsing).
The program was written, compiled, and executed using the Command Prompt (CMD) editor platform on Windows. After proper debugging and execution, the application produced the expected output by displaying weather details in a well-structured format.
